## Key points

- The Beta distribution represents a proportion between 0 and 1, but **does not include 0 or 1**. Zero/one-inflated Beta regression models separate processes for the 0s and 1s

## Distribution intuition

The Beta distribution is great for proportions, but it doesn't work with values that are exactly 0 or 1.

To get around this, we can use a special zero-inflated Beta regression. We'll still model the $\mu$ (mu) and $\phi$ (phi) (or mean and precision) of the beta distribution, but we'll also model one new special parameter $\pi$ (pi; not 3.14, though). With zero-inflated regression, we're actually modelling a mixture of data-generating processes: 

1. A logistic regression model that predicts if an outcome is 0 or not, defined by $\pi$
2. A Beta regression model that predicts if an outcome is between 0 and 1 if it's not zero, defined by $\mu$ and $\phi$

In general, the model looks like this:

$$
\begin{aligned}
Y_i &\sim \operatorname{Zero-inflated\ Beta}(\pi_i, \mu_i, \phi_i) \\
\operatorname{logit}(\pi_i) &= \gamma_0 + \gamma \mathbf{X}_i & \text{on/off process} \\
\operatorname{logit}(\mu_i) &= \beta_0 + \beta \mathbf{X}_i & \gt 0 \text{ process} \\
\log(\phi_i) &= \eta_0 + \eta \mathbf{X}_i & \text{dispersion}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example: Modeling the proprotion of tetanus non-vaccinations

To illustrate this, we'll look at 2020 PAB tetanus vaccination rates, since far more countries have reached or are approaching universal coverage. We'll also cheat a little, since only 3 countries are actually at 100%—for the sake of this example, if a country is at 97% or more, we'll consider that 100%.

Also, we'll look at the reverse of the proportion, or the proportion of unvaccinated, since there is no one-inflated regression built into {brms}. Their suggestion is to either flip the value (like we're doing here) or use zero-one-inflated regression and tell the zero-focused process there to be constant. Flipping the value is easier, so we'll do that.

Let's first see how many 0s we're working with:

```{r}
#| label: calc-prop-zero

tetanus_2020 |> 
  count(prop_unvacc == 0) |> 
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))
```

20% of the countries are fully vaccinated here (or have 0% unvaccinated kids). The 80% of countries with some unvaccinated children still follows a Beta distribution:

```{r}
#| label: show-prop-zero

tetanus_2020 |> 
  mutate(is_zero = prop_unvacc == 0) |> 
  mutate(prop_unvacc = ifelse(is_zero, -0.01, prop_unvacc)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = prop_unvacc, fill = is_zero)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.04, boundary = 0, color = "white") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_percent()) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(
    option = "plasma", end = 0.9,
    guide = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)
  ) +
  labs(
    x = "Proportion of unvaccinated children", 
    y = "Count", fill = "Is zero?"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

The only difference between regular Beta regression and zero-inflated Beta regression is that we have to specify one more parameter: `zi`. This corresponds to the $\pi$ parameter and determines the zero/not-zero process.

To help with the intuition, we'll first run a model where we don't actually define a model for `zi`—it'll just return the intercept for the $\pi$ parameter.

```{r}
#| label: set-priors
priors <- c(
  set_prior("student_t(3, 0, 2.5)", class = "Intercept"),
  set_prior("normal(0, 1)", class = "b"),
  set_prior("logistic(0, 1", class = "Intercept", dpar = "zi")
)
```


```{r}
#| label: model-bayes-zi-int-only
#| results: hide
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: show

# Here we log gdp_per_cap because Stan really doesn't like big numbers
model_beta_zi_int_only <- brm(
  bf(
    prop_unvacc ~ log(gdp_per_cap) + region,
    phi ~ 1,
    zi ~ 1
  ),
  data = tetanus_2020,
  family = zero_inflated_beta(),
  prior = priors,
  chains = 4, iter = 2000, seed = 1234,
  file = "models/model_beta_zi_int_only"
)
```

```{r}
#| label: show-zi-bayes-results
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| code-fold: show
model_parameters(model_beta_zi_int_only, verbose = FALSE) |> tt()
```

We now have a new parameter here, `b_zi_Intercept`, or the $\pi$ in the model. It's on the logit scale, so we can back-transform it with `plogis()`:

```{r}
#| label: backtransform-zi
#| code-fold: show

plogis(-1.39)
```

That 20%ish represents the number of rows in the dataset with 0 unvaccinated children, which is what we found earlier!

For now, we've only done an intercept-only model, but we can model the exact 0/not-0 process. There are probably regional differences (and probably lots of other things) in whether a country is fully vaccinated, so we can include that in the model:

```{r}
#| label: model-bayes-zi
#| results: hide
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: show

model_beta_zi <- brm(
  bf(
    prop_unvacc ~ log(gdp_per_cap) + region,
    phi ~ 1,
    zi ~ region
  ),
  data = tetanus_2020,
  family = zero_inflated_beta(),
  prior = priors,
  chains = 4, iter = 2000, seed = 1234,
  file = "models/model_beta_zi"
)
```

We can look at the individual parts of this model. Here are the posterior predictions of 0s across each region:

```{r}
#| label: plot-zi-region

# With {marginaleffects}
model_beta_zi |> 
  plot_predictions(condition = c("region", "region"), dpar = "zi") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_percent()) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Proportion unvaccinated") +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "plasma", end = 0.9, guide = "none") +
  coord_flip() 

# With {tidybayes}
model_beta_zi |> 
  linpred_draws(
    newdata = data.frame(gdp_per_cap = 10000, region = unique(tetanus_2020$region)),
    dpar = "zi", transform = TRUE
  ) |> 
  ggplot(aes(y = region, x = zi)) +
  stat_halfeye(aes(fill = region), normalize = "xy") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "plasma", end = 0.9, guide = "none") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_percent()) +
  labs(y = NULL, x = "Proportion unvaccinated")
```

All the regular {marginaleffects} and {tidybayes} functions work too, either on individual parts of the model (with the `dpar` argument), or on both combined (without any extra arguments). Like this—we can visualize the posterior distributions of the specific marginal effects *while also incorporating the 0 process*!:

```{r}
#| label: show-mfx-bayes
#| fig-width: 7
#| fig-height: 8

model_beta_zi |> 
  slopes(
    newdata = datagrid(gdp_per_cap = c(1000, 10000, 25000), region = unique),
    variables = "gdp_per_cap"
  ) |> 
  posterior_draws() |> 
  mutate(draw = draw * 1000) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = draw, y = factor(gdp_per_cap), fill = region)) +
  stat_halfeye(normalize = "xy") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_number(scale = 100, suffix = " pp.")) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "plasma", end = 0.9, guide = "none") +
  facet_wrap(vars(region), ncol = 1) +
  labs(
    x = "Percentage point change in proportion of PAB non-vaccination", 
    y = "GDP per capita"
  )
```
